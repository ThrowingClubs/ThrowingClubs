Hi, I’m Patrick. I'm a graduate of Colorado School of Mines and an active juggler (hence the username). My old account is https://github.com/panichol, but I've since lost access to the university email that I used to set it up, so here we are with a new account.

I'm currently working as a C# dev, but I tend to do my personal projects Python.
