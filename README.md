Hi, I’m Patrick. I'm a graduate of Colorado School of Mines and an active juggler (hence the username). My old account is https://github.com/panichol, but I've since lost access to the university email that I used to set it up, so here we are with a new account.

I’m interested in all things Python, and I've a special place in my heart for statistical and mathematical analysis.

If there are private repositories on this profile it's either because I'm still working on the project, or the project is something I don't want to be public. For example the GradeConverter is a solution to an assessment for Hatchways, and I don't want any old person to be able to copy my work. If you would like to see that project feel free to get in touch with me and I can grant you access.
